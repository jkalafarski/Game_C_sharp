# Game_C_sharp
Two years ago I decide to create game for smartphones with Android. It took me aproximetly 150 hours to finish this project. Project was finished in June 2017. My last expirience with Unity,C# and game development was in may 2018, during university course. I decided to leave this career path mostly because of lack of UX/UI taste and skills.
